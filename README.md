## How to Run:
this code doesn't need any third party packages to run. simply download the files to your desktop and then drag the index.html folder into your browser

## Future Improvements
I think it would be really cool to make the packman images smaller and create a maze that is displayed on screen for the packmen to bounce around. I think it would be interesting to see how far they would make it through the maze since they boucne off the walls in the opposite direction they were traveling
